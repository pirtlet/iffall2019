		<div class="Verse">
		Yeah, uh<br>
		Tell me what you really like<br>
		Baby, I can take my time<br>
		We don't ever have to fight<br>
		Just take it step-by-step<br>
		I can see it in your eyes<br>
		'Cause they never tell me lies<br>
		I can feel that body shake<br>
		And the heat between your legs
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="Verse">
		You've been scared of love and what it did to you<br>
		You don't have to run, I know what you've been through<br>
		Just a simple touch and it can set you free<br>
		We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="Chorus">
		I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe<br>
		I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe<br>
		I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe<br>
		I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="Verse">
		You are not the single type<br>
		So baby, this the perfect time<br>
		I'm just trying to get you high<br>
		And faded off this touch<br>
		You don't need a lonely night<br>
		So baby, I can make it right<br>
		You just got to let me try<br>
		To give you what you want<br>
		You've been scared of love and what it did to you<br>
		You don't have to run, I know what you've been through<br>
		Just a simple touch and it can set you free<br>
		We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="Chorus">
		I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe (x8)<br>
		</div>

		<div class="Verse">
		You've been scared of love and what it did to you<br>
		You don't have to run, I know what you've been through<br>

		<div class="Chorus">
		I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe<br>
		I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe<br>
		(I know what you feel right now) (x3)
		<br>
		<br>
		I feel it coming, babe (x4)
